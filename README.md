# Coal-Gasification-Prediction




##### This repo is aimed at Predicting The Performace of Coal Gasification Process ie. Heating Value (MJ/m^3) using features such as 
##### Proximate Analysis
1. ASH
2. Fixed Carbon (FC)
3. Volatile Matter (VM)
together with other parameters like Air to Coal ratio and Steam to Coal ratio.

Obviously, a lot of factors affects the performance of the gasification process such as the ultimate analysis of the coal, thermodynamic properties, Mass and Energy balances to mention but a few
####### Nonetheless, Machine Learning model was created to predict the Heating Value of Coal Gasification Process.
